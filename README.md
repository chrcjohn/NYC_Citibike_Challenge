## The Purpose of project

The  Purpose of this analysis was to identify key information about Citi Bike usage in New York to determine whether it would be possible to launch a similar business.
August was chosen as the month of analysis because the US summer months are similar.

## Checkout Times for Users
The first visualization shows that Citi Bike offers all types of people a great option for short tips in New York.

## Trips by Gender 
From this, we can see that the travel time is short and the demand for bicycles is high. Male users are overwhelmingly more than female users. Men also tend to drive longer hours.

## Users Trips by Gender per Weekdays

This movement shows that as many people as possible commute by bike during the start and end of work weekdays, commuting from home to home. Good for all-day weekend use. 
Most of the subscribers are men, and most of them use the service on weekdays. Non-subscribers are those who use the service on weekends.

## Summary
The visualization speaks for itself. There are more subscribers than regular users, more men than women, and more people on weekdays than on weekends. These indicators are good, but they also imply more detailed information. New York is a big city. We've got a good idea of how to build a story, but we still have work to do to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposition. Now, I would like to see an analysis of when one of our key stakeholders rides a bike.
